# Reverse Input Program in Java

A simple Java program that reverses a input string and prints both the original and reversed strings.

## Explaination 

This Java program demonstrates a basic string reversal operation. It takes a predefined string, reverses it character by character, and then prints both the original and reversed strings to the console.

## How it Works

The program uses a simple algorithm to reverse the string:

1. Initialise a string variable `str` with a predefined value.
2. Initialise an empty string `nstr` to hold the reversed string.
3. Iterate through each character of the original string using a for loop.
4. Inside the loop, extract each character, `ch`, from the original string and adds it to the front of the `nstr` string.
5. Print original and reversed string

## Usage

To use this program:

1. Clone or download the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/William2716057/ReverseText.git
```
2. Compile the Java file using a Java compiler.
3. Run the compiled class file.
4. You will see the original string followed by its reversed version printed in the console.
